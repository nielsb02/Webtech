                <h3>WCAG</h3>
                <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. 
                Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 
                Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. 
                These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general. </p>

                <h3>Using Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to Improve Your Website</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A:</strong>The easiest level to achieve, this improves accessibility for most sites by making it easier for browsing readers to navigate a site and translate its content, but it is still pretty basic.</li>
                    <li><strong>AA:</strong>This level makes content accessible to people with a wider range of disabilities by providing guidance on elements such as color contrast and error identification. Regulators prefer this level.</li>
                    <li><strong>AAA:</strong>The highest level of accessibility compliance, this makes content accessible to the widest range of people, but it can significantly alter the design of a site. Government legislation doesn’t typically require this because it’s not always possible to conform. </li>
                 </ul> 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>The guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. 
                    Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content that is:</h4>
                <ul>
             <li><strong>Perceivable</strong> - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
                 This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)</li>
             <li><strong>Operable</strong> - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
                 This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)</li>
             <li><strong>Understandable</strong> - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
                 This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding) </li>
             <li><strong>Robust</strong> - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
                 This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</li>
                </ul>  
                 <p>If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be able to use the Web.
                 Under each of the principles are guidelines and Success Criteria that help to address these principles for people with disabilities. 
                 There are many general usability guidelines that make content more usable by all people, including those with disabilities.</p>
